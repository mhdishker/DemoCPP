## Steps to Add C++ Code to Your Jetpack compose project with groovy DSL

1. **Set Up NDK (Native Development Kit)**
   - Ensure that the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) is installed. You can install it via Android Studio:
     - Go to `Tools` > `SDK Manager` and select the Show Package Details checkbox
     - In the `SDK Tools` tab, select the NDK checkbox and the checkboxes below it that correspond to the NDK versions you want to install.

2. **Install CMake**
   - CMake is required to build C++ code in Android Studio. Ensure CMake is installed:
     - Go to `Tools` > `SDK Manager` and select the Show Package Details checkbox
     - In the `SDK Tools` tab, check `CMake` and click `Apply` to install it if it's not already installed.

3. **Configure `CMakeLists.txt`**
   - In your Android Studio project, navigate to the `src/main/cpp` directory (create it if it doesnâ€™t exist).
   - Android Studio uses CMake to build C++ code. Ensure you have a `CMakeLists.txt` file in your `cpp` directory.
   - If you don't have one, create it with the following content:
     ```cmake
     cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.1)
     add_library( # Specifies the name of the library.
             native-lin
     
             # Sets the library as a shared library
             SHARED
     
             # Provides a relative path to your source file(s).
             native-lib.cpp
     )
     ```

4. **Create a New C++ File**
   - Now create the `native-lib.cpp`: Right-click on the `cpp` directory, select `New` > `C++ Class` or `C++ Source File` and name it "native-lib.cpp" or any other name

5. **Link C++ Code to Your Android Project**
   - Open your `build.gradle` file (app level) and add the following under the `android` block:
     ```groovy
     android {
     ...
       externalNativeBuild {
           cmake {
               path "src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt"
           }
       }
     ...
     }
     ```
   - Sync your project.

6. **Load C++ Code in Kotlin**
   - To load your C++ library in your Android app, add the following to your `MainActivity.kt`:
     ```kotlin
     companion object {
       init {
         System.loadLibrary("native-lib")
       }
     }
     ```

7. **Declare Native Methods in Kotlin**
   - Declare the native methods you want to use in your Kotlin code:
     ```kotlin
     external fun stringFromCPP(): String?
     ```

8. **Implement Native Methods in C++**
   - In your C++ file (`native-lib.cpp`), implement the native methods:
     ```cpp
      #include <jni.h>
      #include <string>
      
      extern "C" JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL
      Java_com_proximie_democpp_MainActivity_stringFromCPP(JNIEnv* env,jobject ) {
          std::string hello = "Hello from C++";
          return env->NewStringUTF(hello.c_str());
      }
     ```

## Steps to integrating `libbinary-lib.so` into an Android Project

This guide explains how to integrate a precompiled `.so` library (`libbinary-lib.so`) into an Android project that already has an existing C++ source file (`native-lib.cpp`).

1. **Modify `CMakeLists.txt`**

Update your `CMakeLists.txt` file to include both the existing `native-lib.cpp` and `libbinary-lib.cbb`.

```cmake

add_library(
    binary-lib
    SHARED
    binary-lib.cpp )

target_link_libraries(
    binary-lib
    ${log-lib} )
```

2. **Building the `.so` File**

- Build the Project: Run the following command in the project root to build your C++ code into a `.so` file:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
The .so files will be generated for different architectures (e.g., armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64) in the app/build/intermediates/cmake/debug/obj/ directory.

- Locate the .so Files:
  The .so files will be located in:

```bash
app/build/intermediates/cxx/debug/obj/<architecture>/libbinary-lib.so
```
<architecture> refers to armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, or x86_64.

3. **Include the `.so` Files in Your Project**

Create a `libs` directory under `app` and subdirectories for each architecture:

```bash
mkdir -p app/libs/armeabi-v7a
mkdir -p app/libs/arm64-v8a
mkdir -p app/libs/x86
mkdir -p app/libs/x86_64
```
Copy the .so Files:
Copy the compiled .so files into their respective architecture directories:

```bash
cp app/build/intermediates/cxx/debug/obj/armeabi-v7a/libbinary-lib.so  app/libs/armeabi-v7a/
cp app/build/intermediates/cxx/debug/obj/arm64-v8a/libbinary-lib.so  app/libs/arm64-v8a/
cp app/build/intermediates/cxx/debug/obj/x86/libbinary-lib.so  app/libs/x86/
cp app/build/intermediates/cxx/debug/obj/x86_64/libbinary-lib.so  app/libs/x86_64/
```

Configure build.gradle to Include the .so Files:
Ensure that the `build.gradle` file includes the path to the libs directory:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    sourceSets {
        main {
            jniLibs.srcDirs = ['libs']
        }
    }
}
```

4. **Load the Binary Library in Your Kotlin Code**

Load the .so Library:In your MainActivity (or relevant class), load the binary library using System.loadLibrary():
```kotlin
    companion object {
        init {
            System.loadLibrary("native-lib")
            System.loadLibrary("binary-lib")
        }
    }
```
5. **Optional - Cleanup**

Optional: Remove the .cpp File:

If you no longer need the source code in the project, you can remove the binary-lib.cpp file:
```bash
rm app/src/main/cpp/binary-lib.cpp
```

Rebuild the project to ensure everything is working:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
